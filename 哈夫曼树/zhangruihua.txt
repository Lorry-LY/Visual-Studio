There is an old saying in Chinese saying“no general can always defeat the emery”, it means that no one can win all the time, everyone will meet failure sooner or later. Smart people will learn from the failure and then make themselves close to success, while most people will feel frustrated and start to doubt their lives. For me, I think I belong to smart people because I am positive about failure, I will learn from it and then keep moving on. I don’t want to stay at the same station all the time, so I tell myself I will be successful next time. As for my positive attitude, I feel happy about myself.
