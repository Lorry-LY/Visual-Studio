Secondly, review your resume and imagine what the interviews may ask you. Then think about how you should answer the questions. Thirdly, carefully pick out what to wear. Since the job interview is the only time to sell yourself, you ought to make a good impression on the interviewers. Wear tidy suits and keep your shoes clean. Last, have a good sleep before the night of the job interview, because no interviewers will like an interviewee who looks tired and exhausted.
